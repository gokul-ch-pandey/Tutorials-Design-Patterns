1. SingleTon gurantees that only one instance is created and the same is returned all the time.
2. Though singleton objects can be eagerly loaded but as a practice it should be lazily loaded.
	This means object is created when it is required.
3. No parameter are required for the construction of singleton.
4. should have private instance variable and private constructor.
5. 

Question. What is double checked locking (DCL)?
Answer. If we are working in a single threaded application then Lazy loading is sufficient  
		for Singleton objects. But in a multiThread application you need to ensure thread 
		safety. That means two thread accessing getInstance should use it in synchronized way.
		for this we can make the method getInstace synchronized, but this is huge performance hit
		as synchronized method are 100 times slower. The alternate is to use synchronized block of
		code while initializing the singleton object instance.
